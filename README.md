## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design with media queries

### What I learned

**1. Google Fonts Integration:**
  - Integrated Google Fonts using the `@import` rule, giving the typography a clean, modern look.

**2. CSS Reset:**
  - Applied a reset to remove default `margins`, `padding`, and set `box-sizing: border-box` to ensure consistency across browsers.

**3. Flexbox Layout:**
  - Used Flexbox for easy alignment and responsiveness, centering content both vertically and horizontally.

**4. Responsive Design with Media Queries:**
  - Implemented media queries to ensure the layout adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

**5. Button Styling and Hover Effects:**
  - Styled the Sign-Up button with padding, bold text, and hover effects for a better user experience.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
